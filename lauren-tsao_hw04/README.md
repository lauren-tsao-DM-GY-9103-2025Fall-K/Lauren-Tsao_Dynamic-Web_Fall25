# DM-GY 9103: Dynamic Web - Homework Week 04

I made a filter component! (ﾉ´ヮ`)ﾉ*: ･ﾟ

## Next steps

- As I get more data (images of projects etc), I plan to migrate the OBJECTS array into its own separate .js data file.
- Have the option to toggle the filters on and off (so that multiple projects from different categories can be display at the same time)
