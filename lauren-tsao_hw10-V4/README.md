# HW10 (V4) Notes

This homework (V4) uses `Context` in place of prop drilling (V1). This is a refactoring of week 09 - V1's code.

## Brief

Now that we have learned `Context` and refactored our API version of the `Todo App`, let's practice it one more time! Refactor V1 of the `Todo App` to use `Context`. You will have to do the same steps as we did to refactor V2 which used `axios` and `JSON Server`. The version you make will be V4, which uses Local and Application wide state, but remove the `prop drilling` in favor of `Context`.
